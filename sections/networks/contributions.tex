	\begin{itemize}
		\item Path-planning becomes the bottleneck on visibility maps
		\item Networks are a approach for quickly planning paths. 
		\item Different strategies offer a tradeoff between higher-quality paths and lower preprocessing times.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\note{
		There are strategies that achieve near-optimal paths with small preprocessing cost.
