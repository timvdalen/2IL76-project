	\note{So now we have found a scalable algorithm for computing occluded paths. 
However finding an occluded path on the visualization map is not really fast.
When we want to compute a lot of occluded paths on a terrain, we can use pre computing.
This is mainly the case with real terrain data and in video games. 
Real terrain data does not change much. Mountains do not move.
In video games the terrain is predefined and does not change at all.
